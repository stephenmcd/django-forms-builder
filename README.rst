django-forms-builder
====================

** This package was forked to provide a `FILE_STORAGE` setting. **

The `file-storage` branch is the current branch for this.

Created by `Stephen McDonald <http://twitter.com/stephen_mcd>`_

A Django reusable app providing the ability for admin users to create
their own forms within the admin interface, drawing from a range of
field widgets such as regular text fields, drop-down lists and file
uploads. Options are also provided for controlling who gets sent email
notifications when a form is submitted. All form entries are made
available in the admin via filterable reporting with CSV/XLS export.

HTML5 Features
==============

The following HTML5 form features are supported.

* ``placeholder`` attributes
* ``required`` attributes
* ``email`` fields
* ``date`` fields
* ``datetime`` fields
* ``number`` fields
* ``url`` fields


Installation
============

The easiest way to install django-forms-builder is directly from PyPi
using `pip`_ by running the command below::

    $ pip install -U django-forms-builder

Otherwise you can download django-forms-builder and install it directly
from source::

    $ python setup.py install

Once installed you can configure your project to use
django-forms-builder with the following steps.

Add ``forms_builder.forms`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your project's
``settings`` module::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # other apps
        'forms_builder.forms',
    )

If you haven't already, ensure ``django.core.context_processors.request``
is in the ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`` setting in your project's
``settings`` module::

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
        # other context processors
        "django.core.context_processors.request",
        # Django 1.6 also needs:
        'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
    )

Then add ``forms_builder.forms.urls`` to your project's ``urls``
module::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, include, url
    import forms_builder.forms.urls # add this import

    from django.contrib import admin
    admin.autodiscover()

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        # other urlpatterns
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        url(r'^forms/', include(forms_builder.forms.urls)),
    )

Finally, sync your database::

    $ python manage.py syncdb

As of version 0.5, django-forms-builder provides `South`_ migrations.
If you use south in your project, you'll also need to run migrations::

    $ python manage.py migrate forms


Usage
=====

Once installed and configured for your project just go to the admin
page for your project and you will see a new Forms section. In this
you can create and edit forms. Forms are then each viewable with their
own URLs. A template tag ``render_built_form`` is also available for
displaying forms outside of the main form view provided. It will
display a form when given an argument in one of the following
formats, where ``form_instance`` is an instance of the ``Form`` model::

    {% render_built_form form_instance %}
    {% render_built_form form=form_instance %}
    {% render_built_form id=form_instance.id %}
    {% render_built_form slug=form_instance.slug %}

This allows forms to be displayed without having a form instance, using
a form's slug or ID, which could be hard-coded in a template, or stored
in another model instance.


File Uploads
============

It's possible for admin users to create forms that allow file uploads
which can be accessed via a download URL for each file that is provided
in the CSV export. By default these uploaded files are stored in an
obscured location under your project's ``MEDIA_ROOT`` directory but
ideally the should be stored somewhere inaccessible to the public. To
set the location where files are stored to be somewhere outside of your
project's ``MEDIA_ROOT`` directory you just need to define the either the
``FORMS_BUILDER_UPLOAD_ROOT`` setting in your project's ``settings``
module or the ``FORMS_BUILDER_FILE_STORAGE`` setting. The
``FORMS_BUILDER_UPLOAD_ROOT`` value should be an absolute path on the web
server that isn't accessible to the public.


Configuration
=============

The following settings can be defined in your project's ``settings``
module.

* ``FORMS_BUILDER_FIELD_MAX_LENGTH`` - Maximum allowed length for
  field values. Defaults to ``2000``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_LABEL_MAX_LENGTH`` - Maximum allowed length for
  field labels. Defaults to ``20``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_EXTRA_FIELDS`` - Sequence of custom fields that
  will be added to the form field types. Defaults to ``()``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_UPLOAD_ROOT`` - The absolute path where files will
  be uploaded to. Defaults to ``None``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_FILE_STORAGE`` - The class path of the Django storage class
  to use for storing files. Defaults to ``None`` which uses the default file
  storage.
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_USE_HTML5`` - Boolean controlling whether HTML5 form
  fields are used. Defaults to ``True``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_USE_SITES`` - Boolean controlling whether forms are
  associated to Django's Sites framework.
  Defaults to ``"django.contrib.sites" in settings.INSTALLED_APPS``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_EDITABLE_SLUGS`` - Boolean controlling whether form
  slugs are editable in the admin. Defaults to ``False``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_CHOICES_QUOTE`` - Char to start a quoted choice with.
  Defaults to the backtick char: `
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_CHOICES_UNQUOTE`` - Char to end a quoted choice with.
  Defaults to the backtick char: `
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_CSV_DELIMITER`` - Char to use as a field delimiter
  when exporting form responses as CSV. Defaults to a comma: ,
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_EMAIL_FAIL_SILENTLY`` - Bool used for Django's
  ``fail_silently`` argument when sending email.
  Defaults to ``settings.DEBUG``.


Custom Fields and Widgets
=========================

You can also add your own custom fields or widgets to the choices of
fields available for a form. Simply define a sequence for the
``FORMS_BUILDER_EXTRA_FIELDS`` setting in your project's ``settings``
module, where each item in the sequence is a custom field that will
be available.

Each field in the sequence should be a three-item sequence containing
an ID, a dotted import path for the field class, and a field name, for
each custom field type. The ID is simply a numeric constant for the
field, but cannot be a value already used, so choose a high number
such as 100 or greater to avoid conflicts::

  FORMS_BUILDER_EXTRA_FIELDS = (
      (100, "django.forms.BooleanField", "My cool checkbox"),
      (101, "my_module.MyCustomField", "Another field"),
  )

You can also define custom widget classes for any of the existing or
custom form fields via the ``FORMS_BUILDER_EXTRA_WIDGETS`` setting.
Each field in the sequence should be a two-item sequence containing
the same ID referred to above for the form field class, and a dotted
import path for the widget class::

  FORMS_BUILDER_EXTRA_WIDGETS = (
      (100, "my_module.MyCoolWidget"),
      (101, "my_other_module.AnotherWidget"),
  )

Note that using the ``FORMS_BUILDER_EXTRA_WIDGETS`` setting to define
custom widgets for field classes of your own is somewhat redundant,
since you could simply define the widgets on the field classes directly
in their code.


Email Templates
===============

The `django-email-extras`_ package is used to send multipart email
notifications using Django's templating system for constructing the
emails, to users submitting forms, and any recipients specified when
creating a form via Django's admin.

Templates for HTML and text versions of the email can be found in the
``templates/email_extras`` directory. This allows you to customize the
look and feel of emails that are sent to form submitters. Along with
each of the ``form_response`` email templates which are used to email
the form submitter, you'll also find corresponding
``form_response_copies`` templates, that extend the former set - these
are used as the templates for emailing any extra recipients specified
for the form in the admin interface. By default they simply extend
the ``form_response`` templates, but you can modify them should you
need to customize the emails sent to any extra recipients.

.. note::

    With ``django-email-extras`` installed, it's also possible to
    configure `PGP`_ encrypted emails to be send to staff members,
    allowing forms to be built for capturing sensitive information.
    Consult the `django-email-extras`_ documentation for more info.


Signals
=======

Two signals are provided for hooking into different states of the form
submission process.

* ``form_invalid(sender=request, form=form)`` - Sent when the form is
  submitted with invalid data.
* ``form_valid(sender=request, form=form, entry=entry)`` - Sent when
  the form is submitted with valid data.

For each signal the sender argument is the current request. Both
signals receive a ``form`` argument is given which is the
``FormForForm`` instance, a ``ModelForm`` for the ``FormEntry`` model.
The ``form_valid`` signal also receives a ``entry`` argument, which is
the ``FormEntry`` model instance created.

Some examples of using the signals would be to monitor how users are
causing validation errors with the form, or a pipeline of events to
occur on successful form submissions. Suppose we wanted to store a
logged in user's username against each form when submitted, given
a form containing a field with the label ``Username`` with its
field_type set to ``Hidden``::

    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from forms_builder.forms.signals import form_valid

    @receiver(form_valid)
    def set_username(sender=None, form=None, entry=None, **kwargs):
        request = sender
        if request.user.is_authenticated():
            field = entry.form.fields.get(label="Username")
            field_entry, _ = entry.fields.get_or_create(field_id=field.id)
            field_entry.value = request.user.username
            field_entry.save()


Dynamic Field Defaults
======================

As of version 0.6, you can use Django template code for default field
values. For example you could enter ``{{ request.user.username }}`` and
the field will be pre-populated with a user's username if they're
authenticated.


XLS Export
==========

By default, django-forms-builder provides export of form entries via
CSV file. You can also enable export via XLS file (Microsoft Excel)
by installing the `xlwt`_ package::

  $ pip install xlwt
