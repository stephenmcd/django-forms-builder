django-forms-builder
====================

Created by `Stephen McDonald <http://twitter.com/stephen_mcd>`_

A Django reusable app providing the ability for admin users to create
their own forms within the admin interface drawing from a range of
field widgets such as regular text fields, drop-down lists and file
uploads. Options are also provided for controlling who gets sent email
notifications when a form is submitted. All form entries are made
available in the admin via CSV export.

HTML5 Features
==============

The following HTML5 form features are supported.

* ``placeholder`` attributes
* ``required`` attributes
* ``email`` fields
* ``date`` fields
* ``datetime`` fields
* ``number`` fields
* ``url`` fields

Installation
============

The easiest way to install django-forms-builder is directly from PyPi
using `pip`_ or `setuptools`_ by running the respective command below::

    $ pip install -U django-forms-builder

or::

    $ easy_install -U django-forms-builder

Otherwise you can download django-forms-builder and install it directly
from source::

    $ python setup.py install

Project Configuration
=====================

Once installed you can configure your project to use
django-forms-builder with the following steps.

Add ``forms_builder.forms`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your project's
``settings`` module::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.sites',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'forms_builder.forms',
    )

Then add ``forms_builder.forms.urls`` to your project's ``urls``
module::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, include, url
    import forms_builder.forms.urls # add this import

    from django.contrib import admin
    admin.autodiscover()

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        url(r'^forms/', include(forms_builder.forms.urls)),
    )

Finally, sync your database::

    $ python manage.py syncdb

As of version 0.5, django-forms-builder provides `South`_ migrations. If
you use south in your project, you'll also need to run migrations::

    $ python manage.py migrate forms

Usage
=====

Once installed and configured for your project just go to the admin
page for your project and you will see a new Forms section. In this
you can create and edit forms. Forms are then each viewable with their
own URLs. A template tag ``render_built_form`` is also available for
displaying forms outside of the main form view provided. It will
display a form when given an argument in one of the following
formats, where ``form_instance`` is an instance of the ``Form`` model::

    {% render_build_form form_instance %}
    {% render_build_form form=form_instance %}
    {% render_build_form id=form_instance.id %}
    {% render_build_form slug=form_instance.slug %}

This allows forms to be displayed without having a form instance, using
a form's slug or ID, which could be hard-coded in a template, or stored
in another model instance.

File Uploads
============

It's possible for admin users to create forms that allow file uploads
which can be accessed via a download URL for each file that is provided
in the CSV export. By default these uploaded files are stored in an
obscured location under your project's ``MEDIA_ROOT`` directory but
ideally the should be stored somewhere inaccessible to the public. To
set the location where files are stored to be somewhere outside of your
project's ``MEDIA_ROOT`` directory you just need to define the
``FORMS_BUILDER_UPLOAD_ROOT`` setting in your project's ``settings``
module. Its value should be an absolute path on the web server that
isn't accessible to the public.

Configuration
=============

The following settings can be defined in your project's ``settings``
module.

* ``FORMS_BUILDER_FIELD_MAX_LENGTH`` - Maximum allowed length for
  field values. Defaults to ``2000``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_LABEL_MAX_LENGTH`` - Maximum allowed length for
  field labels. Defaults to ``20``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_UPLOAD_ROOT`` - The absolute path where files will
  be uploaded to. Defaults to ``None``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_USE_HTML5`` - Boolean controlling whether HTML5 form
  fields are used. Defaults to ``True``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_USE_SITES`` - Boolean controlling whether forms are
  associated to Django's Sites framework. Defaults to
  ``"django.contrib.sites" in settings.INSTALLED_APPS``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_EDITABLE_SLUGS`` - Boolean controlling whether form
  slugs are editable in the admin. Defaults to ``False``
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_CHOICES_QUOTE`` - Char to start a quoted choice with.
  Defaults to the backtick char: `
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_CHOICES_UNQUOTE`` - Char to end a quoted choice with.
  Defaults to the backtick char: `
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_CSV_DELIMITER`` - Char to use as a field delimiter
  when exporting form responses as CSV. Defaults to a comma: ,
* ``FORMS_BUILDER_SEND_FROM_SUBMITTER`` - Boolean controlling whether
  emails to staff recipients are sent from the form submitter. Defaults
  to ``True``

Email Templates
===============

The `django-email-extras`_ package is used to send multipart email
notifications using Django's templating system for constructing the
emails, to users submitting forms, and any recipients specified when
creating a form via Django's admin.

Templates for HTML and text versions of the email can be found in the
``templates/email_extras`` directory. This allows you to customize the
look and feel of emails that are sent to form submitters.

.. note::

    With ``django-email-extras`` installed, it's also possible to
    configure `PGP`_ encrypted emails to be send to staff members,
    allowing forms to be built for capturing sensitive information.
    Consult the `django-email-extras`_ documentation for more info.

Signals
=======

Two signals are provided for hooking into different states of the form
submission process.

* ``form_invalid(sender=request, form=form)`` - Sent when the form is
  submitted with invalid data.
* ``form_valid(sender=request, form=form, entry=entry)`` - Sent when
  the form is submitted with valid data.

For each signal the sender argument is the current request. Both
signals receive a ``form`` argument is given which is the
``FormForForm`` instance, a ``ModelForm`` for the ``FormEntry`` model.
The ``form_valid`` signal also receives a ``entry`` argument, which is
the ``FormEntry`` model instance created.

Some examples of using the signals would be to monitor how users are
causing validation errors with the form, or a pipeline of events to
occur on successful form submissions. Suppose we wanted to store a
logged in user's username against each form when submitted, given
a form containing a field with the label ``Username`` with its
field_type set to ``Hidden``::

    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from forms_builder.forms.signals import form_valid

    @receiver(form_valid)
    def set_username(sender=None, form=None, entry=None, **kwargs):
        request = sender
        if request.user.is_authenticated():
            field = entry.form.fields.get(label="Username")
            field_entry, _ = entry.fields.get_or_create(field_id=field.id)
            field_entry.value = request.user.username
            field_entry.save()

Dynamic Field Defaults
======================

As of version 0.6, you can use Django template code for default field
values. For example you could enter ``{{ request.user.username }}`` and
the field will be pre-populated with a user's username if they're
authenticated.

XLS Export
==========

By default, django-forms-builder provides export of form entries via
CSV file. You can also enable export via XLS file (Microsoft Excel)
by installing the `xlwt`_ package::

  $ pip install xlwt
