Introduction
============

A Django reusable app providing the ability for admin users to create their
own forms within the admin interface drawing from a range of field widgets
such as regular text fields, drop-down lists and file uploads. Options are
also provided for controlling who gets sent email notifications when a form
is submitted. All form entries are made available in the admin via CSV export.

HTML5 Features
==============

The folliwng HTML5 form features are supported.

  * ``placeholder`` attributes
  * ``required`` attributes
  * ``email`` fields
  * ``date`` fields
  * ``datetime`` fields
  * ``number`` fields
  * ``url`` fields

Installation
============

The easiest way to install django-forms-builder is directly from PyPi using
`pip`_ or `setuptools`_ by running the respective command below::

    $ pip install -U django-forms-builder

or::

    $ easy_install -U django-forms-builder

Otherwise you can download django-forms-builder and install it directly
from source::

    $ python setup.py install

Once installed you can then add ``forms_builder.forms`` to your
``INSTALLED_APPS`` and ``forms_builder.forms.urls`` to your url conf.

File Uploads
============

It's possible for admin users to create forms that allow file uploads which
can be accessed via a download URL for each file that is provided in the
CSV export. By default these uploaded files are stored in an obscured
location under your project's ``MEDIA_ROOT`` directory but ideally the
should be stored somewhere inaccessible to the public. To set the location
where files are stored to be somewhere outside of your project's
``MEDIA_ROOT`` directory you just need to define the
``FORMS_BUILDER_UPLOAD_ROOT`` setting in your project's ``settings``
module. Its value should be an absolute path on the web server that isn't
accessible to the public.

Configuration
=============

The following settings can be defined in your project's ``settings`` module.

  * ``FORMS_BUILDER_FIELD_MAX_LENGTH`` - Maximum allowed length for field values. Defaults to ``2000``
  * ``FORMS_BUILDER_LABEL_MAX_LENGTH`` - Maximum allowed length for field labels. Defaults to ``20``
  * ``FORMS_BUILDER_CHOICES_MAX_LENGTH`` - Maximum allowed length for field choices. Defaults to ``FORMS_BUILDER_FIELD_MAX_LENGTH``
  * ``FORMS_BUILDER_UPLOAD_ROOT`` - The absolute path where files will be uploaded to. Defaults to ``None``
  * ``FORMS_BUILDER_USE_HTML5`` - Boolean controlling whether HTML5 form fields are used. Defaults to ``True``
  * ``FORMS_BUILDER_USE_SITES`` - Boolean controlling whether forms are associated to Django's Sites framework. Defaults to ``"django.contrib.sites" in settings.INSTALLED_APPS``
  * ``FORMS_BUILDER_CHOICES_QUOTE`` - Char to start a quoted choice with. Defaults to the backtick char: `
  * ``FORMS_BUILDER_CHOICES_UNQUOTE`` - Char to end a quoted choice with. Defaults to the backtick char: `
  * ``FORMS_BUILDER_CSV_DELIMITER`` - Char to use as a field delimiter when exporting form responses as CSV. Defaults to a comma: ,

Signals
=======

Two signals are provided for hooking into different states of the form
submission process.


  * ``form_invalid(sender=request, form=form)`` - Sent when the form is submitted with invalid data.
  * ``form_valid(sender=request, form=form, entry=entry)`` - Sent when the form is submitted with valid data.

For each signal the sender argument is the current request. Both signals
receive a ``form`` argument is given which is the ``FormForForm``
instance, a ``ModelForm`` for the ``FormEntry`` model.

The ``form_valid`` signal also receives a ``entry`` argument, which is
the ``FormEntry`` model instance created.
